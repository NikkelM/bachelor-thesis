Short description of Reinforcement learning:

- Agent interacts with the environment only on the basis of a state, which contains information about the 
environment that the agent can use to decide on one of a number of specified actions it can take.

\section{An Overview of Reinforcement-Learning}


Agents to be trained for real-world use
Training in an isolated environment
Need to make sure they are "good"
What we want to offer with our framework
Determining the grade of an agent using monitoring
