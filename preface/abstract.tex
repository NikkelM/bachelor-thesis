Sustainable recommerce markets are growing faster than ever. However, businesses now face the challenge of having to price the same item three times: One price for the new item, one for its refurbished version and the price at which items are bought back from customers. Since these prices are heavily influenced by each other, traditional pricing methods become less effective. To solve this dynamic pricing problem, a simulation framework was built which can be used to train artificial vendors to set optimal prices using Reinforcement-Learning algorithms.
Before employing these trained agents in real markets, their fitness must be monitored and evaluated, as even the smallest mistake by the agent can lead to high costs for the business. This thesis introduces a number of ways that agents can be monitored. We come to the conclusion that the most effective tools are... \todo{...todo}
