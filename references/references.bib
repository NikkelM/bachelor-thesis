abstract = {The circular economy concept has gained momentum both among scholars and practitioners. However, critics claim that it means many different things to different people. This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept.}

abstract={Dynamic pricing is the dynamic adjustment of prices to consumers depending upon the value these customers attribute to a product or service. Today's digital economy is ready for dynamic pricing; however recent research has shown that the prices will have to be adjusted in fairly sophisticated ways, based on sound mathematical models, to derive the benefits of dynamic pricing. This article attempts to survey different models that have been used in dynamic pricing. We first motivate dynamic pricing and present underlying concepts, with several examples, and explain conditions under which dynamic pricing is likely to succeed. We then bring out the role of models in computing dynamic prices. The models surveyed include inventory-based models, data-driven models, auctions, and machine learning. We present a detailed example of an e-business market to show the use of reinforcement learning in dynamic pricing.},

abstract={This paper presents a Q-learning method that works in continuous domains. Other characteristics of our approach are the use of an incremental topology preserving map (ITPM) to partition the input space, and the incorporation of bias to initialize the learning process. A unit of the ITPM represents a limited region of the input space and maps it onto the Q-values of M possible discrete actions. The resulting continuous action is an average of the discrete actions of the ``winning unit'' weighted by their Q-values. Then, TD($\lambda$) updates the Q-values of the discrete actions according to their contribution. Units are created incrementally and their associated Q-values are initialized by means of domain knowledge. Experimental results in robotics domains show the superiority of the proposed continuous-action Q-learning over the standard discrete-action version in terms of both asymptotic performance and speed of learning. The paper also reports a comparison of discounted-reward against average-reward Q-learning in an infinite horizon robotics task.},

Taking a step towards ensuring that reported results are consistent, we propose a new comprehensive evaluation methodology for reinforcement learning algorithms that produces reliable measurements of performance both on a single environment and when aggregated across environments. We demonstrate this method by evaluating a broad class of reinforcement learning algorithms on standard benchmark tasks.}

abstract = {Abstract The market for second-hand luxury products is growing and the variety of available sales channels has increased; consumers can buy second-hand luxury goods not only from brick-and-mortar stores but also from a myriad of both global and local online channels. Arguably, the increase in available sales channels has changed consumers’ purchasing behaviour as the roles between sellers and buyers are alternating as one can act as a buyer one day and a seller the next. However, prior research on luxury consumption has mainly focused on brand-new luxury goods, largely neglecting the consumption of previously-used luxury products and has not accounted for the multi-channel shopping environment. The purpose of this paper is to understand how consumers mentally approach the purchase of second-hand luxury products and what kinds of decision-making styles they use. The empirical interview data of 22 consumers was analysed by the means of shopping style dimensions that account for both consumer characteristics and external shopping conditions. The interviewees were members of a Facebook buy and sell -group focused on luxury products and had recently bought a second-hand luxury product. All the existing dimensions were evident in the data but an additional dimension was also identified: resale value consciousness. The new dimension emphasizes an investment-led and price-quality conscious shopping style but was also found to relate to impulse buying and brand consciousness. The emergence of the dimension is argued to be due to the increase in viable online sales channels for second-hand luxury products.},

We first define the concept of second-hand buying and describe the characteristics of the phenomenon that support a motivation-based approach. Then, we develop a measurement scale following the procedure advocated by Churchill (1979) and reexamined by Rossiter (2002). A preliminary qualitative study conducted with 15 buyers of second-hand goods and a two-stage data collection among 708 individuals provide a final, reliable and valid 7-factor scale that can be used separately or combined in two main dimensions — economic and recreational — to predict internal or external outcome variables. }

For this challenge, participants submitted algorithms for pricing and demand learning of which the numerical performance was analyzed in simulated market environments. This allows consideration of market dynamics that are not analytically tractable or can not be empirically analyzed due to practical complications. Our findings implicate that the relative performance of algorithms varies substantially across different market dynamics, which confirms the intrinsic complexity of pricing and learning in the presence of competition.},

abstract = {We envision a future in which the global economy and the Internet will merge, evolving into an information economy bustling with billions of economically motivated software agents that exchange information goods and services with humans and other agents. Economic software agents will differ in important ways from their human counterparts, and these differences may have significant beneficial or harmful effects upon the global economy. It is therefore important to consider the economic incentives and behaviors of economic software agents, and to use every available means to anticipate their collective interactions. We survey research conducted by the Information Economies group at IBM Research aimed at understanding collective interactions among agents that dynamically price information goods or services. In particular, we study the potential impact of widespread shopbot usage on prices, the price dynamics that may ensue from various mixtures of automated pricing agents (or “pricebots”), the potential use of machine-learning algorithms to improve profits, and more generally the interplay among learning, optimization, and dynamics in agent-based information economies. These studies illustrate both beneficial and harmful collective behaviors that can arise in such systems, suggest possible cures for some of the undesired phenomena, and raise fundamental theoretical issues, particularly in the realms of multi-agent learning and dynamic optimization.}
