- Glossary-type chapter for important keywords
- remove stuff from the ToC (subsections etc.)
- Make sure code-y things are in \texttt{}
- Add a link to the recommerce repository?
- format labels to use meta-info for sections etc. (sec: vs section:) https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Labels_and_Cross-referencing
- Order items in Appendix according to when they are referenced first/according to their types
- Numbered section not in ToC: https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11333
	- number sections manually; \section*{1.2\space\space Section Title}
	- works only in chapters with no section in ToC (because of the counter)
- check if all ref's are numbered correctly, same with sections
- https://carbon.now.sh/ for code
- Arbeiten der anderen zitieren
- Shorten/simplify class names, especially the RuleBased-Agents

- direct vs. indirect speech
- tenses
- gender neutrality (he vs. she vs. they for the user for example)

- Capitalization, especially Rulebased, Reinforcement-Learning
- \emph should be used consistently

Seemingly interchangeable phrases should be identical/used correctly across the thesis:
- monitoring session vs. monitoring run
- market simulation vs. market situation vs. (market) scenario
- re-buy vs. rebuy and re-sell vs. resell
	- rebuy prices vs. rebuy-prices
- refurbished vs. used
- we vs. one vs. users
- in the real market vs. on the real market
- effect vs. affect
- reinforcement-learning vs. Reinforcement Learning vs. RL vs. Reinforcement-Learning vs. ...
- TensorFlow not Tensorflow (same for board)

- make sure vendors vs. agents is always used correctly


approaches chapter:
- "A" monitoring session vs. "The" monitoring session

workflow chapter:
- in the section for config files -> mention webserver?
